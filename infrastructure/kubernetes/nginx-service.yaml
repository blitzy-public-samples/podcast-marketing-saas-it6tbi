# Human Tasks:
# 1. Verify service port configuration matches application requirements
# 2. Ensure network policies allow traffic to this service
# 3. Review and adjust service type based on environment needs (ClusterIP vs LoadBalancer)
# 4. Configure external load balancer settings if using LoadBalancer type

# Requirement Addressed:
# - Nginx Service in Kubernetes (7.5 Deployment Architecture/7.5.1 Infrastructure Requirements)
#   Provides a service configuration to expose the Nginx reverse proxy within the Kubernetes cluster.
