# Requirement Addressed:
# - Backend Autoscaling in Kubernetes (7.5 Deployment Architecture/7.5.1 Infrastructure Requirements)
#   Provides an HPA configuration to dynamically scale the backend pods based on CPU utilization.

# Human Tasks:
# 1. Verify that metrics-server is installed and running in the cluster
# 2. Monitor initial scaling behavior and adjust thresholds if needed
# 3. Consider adding memory-based scaling metrics if required
# 4. Ensure backend deployment has resource requests/limits properly configured
