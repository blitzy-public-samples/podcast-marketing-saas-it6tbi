# Flake8 Configuration
# Tool Version: flake8==6.0.0
# Requirements Addressed:
# - Code Quality and Consistency (7.3 Technical Decisions/7.3.1 Architecture Patterns)
#   Ensures Python code adheres to PEP 8 standards and project-specific linting rules

[flake8]
# Set maximum line length to 88 characters to be compatible with black formatter
max-line-length = 88

# Exclude directories and files from linting
exclude = 
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    migrations,
    venv,
    node_modules

# Ignore specific error codes:
# E203: Whitespace before ':' (conflicts with black)
# W503: Line break before binary operator (conflicts with black)
ignore = E203,W503

# Show the source code generating each error
show-source = true

# Count the number of occurrences of each error/warning code
statistics = true

# Set the maximum complexity allowed for a block of code
max-complexity = 10

# Output formatting
format = %(path)s:%(row)d:%(col)d: %(code)s %(text)s

# Set the number of spaces required for indentation
indent-size = 4

# Ensure proper docstring conventions
