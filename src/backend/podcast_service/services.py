"""
Core services for podcast management, including processing podcast episodes,
validating audio files, extracting metadata, and integrating with AI services.

Requirements Addressed:
- Podcast Management (1.3 Scope/In-Scope Elements/Core Features and Functionalities):
  Supports podcast management by providing services for processing podcast episodes,
  validating audio files, and extracting metadata.
- AI Integration (1.2 System Overview/High-Level Description/AI Integration):
  Integrates with AI services like Whisper for transcription and GPT for content generation.
- Scalability (7.3 Technical Decisions/7.3.1 Architecture Patterns):
  Implements scalable services to handle resource-intensive operations.

Human Tasks:
1. Configure appropriate storage backend for audio file processing
2. Review error handling and logging configuration
3. Monitor AI service integration performance and costs
4. Verify audio processing resource allocation
