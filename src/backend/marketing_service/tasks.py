Marketing Service Asynchronous Tasks

This module defines Celery tasks for handling asynchronous operations in the marketing service,
including social media post scheduling, analytics retrieval, and campaign management.

Requirements Addressed:
- Marketing Automation (1.3 Scope/Core Features and Functionalities/Marketing Automation):
  Implements asynchronous tasks for multi-platform post scheduling, content optimization,
  and campaign analytics.
- Asynchronous Task Processing (7.3 Technical Decisions/7.3.1 Architecture Patterns):
  Provides Celery-based task definitions for handling asynchronous operations.

Human Tasks:
1. Configure Celery worker instances for production deployment
2. Set up monitoring for failed tasks and retries
3. Review task queue configuration for optimal performance
4. Configure task result backend storage settings
